## Description
The application inadvertently exposes sensitive information at {URL}. This may include API keys, database credentials, personally identifiable information (PII), or detailed stack traces generated by application errors.

## Impact
Exposure of sensitive data can facilitate further attacks. For example, leaked API keys can be used to access third-party services, and stack traces can reveal software versions and file paths, aiding in the crafting of specific exploits. PII leaks lead to privacy violations and compliance failures.

## Validation Steps
1. Navigate to the target URL or trigger an error condition (e.g., by sending malformed JSON).
2. Inspect the HTTP response body and headers.
3. Look for sensitive patterns such as `API_KEY`, `password`, emails, credit card numbers, or stack trace dumps.
4. Verify if the data is intended for public viewing.

## Fix Recommendation
Configure the application to suppress detailed error messages in the production environment. Ensure sensitive data is identified and classified. Implement generic error pages and scrub sensitive headers or comments from HTTP responses before they are sent to the client.
