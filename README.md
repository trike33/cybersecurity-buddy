# cybersecurity-buddy
A tool to make pentest and BB engagments more light for cybersecurity profesionals


contains pokemons media files took from `https://github.com/jakobhoeg/vscode-pokemon/tree/main/media` (special thanks!)

even though releases are available, i personally recommend you downloading the project installing a venv and launching the app from there!
