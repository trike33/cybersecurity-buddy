## 💖 Support

If you enjoy this project, please consider supporting me.
Manually creating the `.gif` files for each sprite takes a lot of time and effort.
Your sponsorship helps me dedicate more energy to improve and expand the project.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

VS Code Pokémon comes with default keyboard shortcuts to make managing your Pokémon quick and easy:

![Keybindings](https://github.com/jakobhoeg/vscode-pokemon/raw/main/keybindings.png)

### Configuring Keyboard Shortcuts

You can customize these shortcuts to match your preferences:

1. Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd(⌘)+Shift+P` on MacOS)
2. Run the **`Pokemon Coding: Configure keybindings`** command
3. Select the command you want to customize
4. VS Code will open the Keyboard Shortcuts editor filtered to that command
5. Click the pencil icon next to the command and press your desired key combination

## Changing settings

Open the setting panel with Ctrl+, on Windows/Linux or Cmd(⌘)+, on MacOS. In the search bar, enter “vscode-pokemon" to see all available options.

Set the size and position of the extension.

### Default Pokémon

You can configure specific Pokémon to automatically appear when you first start using the extension. This is useful for setting up your preferred team without having to manually spawn them when you open new windows.

To configure default Pokémon, add the following to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "vscode-pokemon.defaultPokemon": [
    {
      "type": "pikachu",
      "name": "Sparky"
    },
    {
      "type": "charizard",
      "name": "Flame"
    },
    {
      "type": "articuno"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **`type`** (required): The Pokémon species (e.g., `"pikachu"`, `"charizard"`, `"mewtwo"`)
- **`name`** (optional): A custom name for your Pokémon. If not provided, a random name will be assigned

**Note:** The extension automatically saves your current Pokémon between sessions. The `defaultPokemon` setting is only used when:
- You start the extension for the first time
- You open a new windows/repository
- You have removed all Pokémon (no saved session exists)

To reset to your default Pokémon, use the "Remove all pokemon" command and restart VS Code.

## Upcoming features

Extracting and creating .gif files involves quite a bit of tedious manual work, but I’ll aim to add Gen 4 soon!
